            My name is Mary-Ann Marshall and I am a digital
            and tradtion artist. I love to paint portraits the most.
            faces have always fasinated me. I quite good at reading
            the expressions of other. I love trying to emulate the emotions
            of others through my art. I love to evoke the moody and
            peronsailty of my human paintings :)
